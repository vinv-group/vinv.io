    <p>
        This standardization enables data to be captured and processed from one data source (<span class=\"heighlight\">.vinv</span> file or compatible databases) - regardless of the technical equipment or financial capabilities of the users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to the standardized form, this uniform data basis can be used in various applications such as <span class=\"heighlight\">visualizations</span>, <span class=\"heighlight\">scientific analyses</span> or <span class=\"heighlight\">forest management</span>.
